In this project, my objective was to computationally model the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin's effects on the Hodgkin Huxley Neuron. To achieve this, I referred to previous mathematical models of the HH neuron (cited below) and developed my own model. In my model, I incorporated multiple mathematical functions for sodium channels and adjusted various parameters. Subsequently, I simulated the neuron and visualized the spike train, observing a total of 3 spikes. This analysis aimed to provide insights into how the drug alters excitability in the brain.

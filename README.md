In this project, I aimed to compuationally model the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin through the Hodgkin Huxley Neuron. In order to do so referenced previous mathematical models of HH neuron, cited below, and I developed my own model in which I added multiple sodium chanel mathematical functions, and adjusted the paramters. I then simulated the neuron and visualized the spike train of a total of 3 spikes to understand how excitability in the brain is altered by the drug.
